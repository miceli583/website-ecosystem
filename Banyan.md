Banyan is a fully integrated LifeOS available on webapp and mobile. It features AI that integrates your various life domains, and helps you understand how these domains influence each other: so that your goals simply become the natural by product of your habits, and your habits are aligned with your deepest values.

LifeOS is a comprehensive framework that helps you run your life like you'd run a well-designed system—with clarity, intention, and coherence across all domains.

At its core, LifeOS treats your life as an integrated whole rather than disconnected parts. Just as your computer's operating system manages files, applications, and processes seamlessly, LifeOS helps you manage your energy, attention, commitments, and growth in a way that everything works together rather than competing for resources.

The framework typically encompasses several key dimensions: your relationships and connection to others, your physical health and embodiment, your creative work and contribution, your financial sustainability, your mental clarity and learning, and your spiritual grounding or sense of meaning. Rather than optimizing any single area at the expense of others, LifeOS helps you see how these domains influence each other and find sustainable rhythms across all of them.

What makes LifeOS powerful is that it's not about adding more productivity hacks or squeezing more output from yourself. It's about designing protocols and practices that align with how you actually want to live—your values, your natural rhythms, your definition of success. It creates space for both structure and spontaneity, for discipline and rest, for ambition and contentment.

The system becomes your personal infrastructure for translating vision into daily reality, ensuring that your big-picture dreams and your moment-to-moment choices are in conversation with each other. It's less about perfection and more about conscious design—building a life that feels coherent, purposeful, and genuinely yours.
