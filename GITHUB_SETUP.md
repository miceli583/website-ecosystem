# GitHub Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your repository on GitHub and leveraging the built-in CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ Quick GitHub Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
2. Choose your repository name (e.g., `website-ecosystem`)
3. **Keep it private** initially (you can make it public later)
4. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Local Repository

GitHub will show you commands, but here's what you need to run:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual values.**

### 3. Verify CI/CD Pipeline

Once pushed, your CI/CD pipeline will automatically run! You can:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. You should see a workflow running called "CI"
4. Click on it to see the build progress

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Details

### What Runs Automatically

**On every push to `main` or `develop`:**

- ‚úÖ **Code linting** (ESLint)
- ‚úÖ **Code formatting check** (Prettier)
- ‚úÖ **Type checking** (TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ **Build verification** (Next.js production build)

**On every pull request:**

- ‚úÖ Same checks as above
- ‚úÖ **Blocks merging** if any check fails
- ‚úÖ **Status checks** visible in PR

### Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  lint-and-typecheck:
    # Runs ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks

  build:
    # Verifies the app builds successfully
```

### Environment Variables

The CI pipeline uses `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` during builds to avoid requiring production environment variables in CI.

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection (Recommended)

Set up branch protection rules to enforce code quality:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** for `main` branch
4. Enable these settings:
   - ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - Select: `Lint and Type Check`
     - Select: `Build`
   - ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB**

This ensures all code goes through the CI pipeline before reaching main.

## üîß Local Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... code, code, code ...

# Check your code locally (optional but recommended)
npm run lint          # Check linting
npm run format:check  # Check formatting
npm run typecheck     # Check types
npm run build         # Test build

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Creating Pull Requests

1. Push your feature branch (command above)
2. Go to GitHub ‚Üí your repository
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Add description of your changes
5. Click "Create pull request"
6. **Wait for CI checks** ‚úÖ before merging
7. Merge when ready!

## üöÄ Deployment Options

Your app is ready for deployment to:

### Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your project
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
   AUTH_DISCORD_ID=your-discord-id
   AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET=your-discord-secret
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   ```
4. Deploy automatically on every push to `main`

### Netlify

1. Connect repository to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.next`
4. Add environment variables

### Railway

1. Connect to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Add PostgreSQL database
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy from GitHub

### Docker (Self-hosted)

A `Dockerfile` can be added for containerized deployment.

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### GitHub Insights

- **Actions tab**: View CI/CD pipeline history
- **Insights tab**: Code frequency, contributors, traffic
- **Security tab**: Dependabot alerts and security advisories

### Recommended Additions

1. **Dependabot**: Auto-update dependencies (enable in Security tab)
2. **CodeQL**: Static security analysis (enable in Security tab)
3. **Issue templates**: For bug reports and feature requests
4. **Pull request templates**: Standardize PR descriptions

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** using the commands above
2. **Set up branch protection** for code quality
3. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify** for live preview
4. **Add real OAuth credentials** for authentication
5. **Set up database** (PostgreSQL for production)

Your foundation is now GitHub-ready with professional CI/CD! üéâ
